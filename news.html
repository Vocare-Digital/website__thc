          <h3>Totally Healthcare appoints Marie lee as Managing Director </h3>
          <p>
            Marie Lee has today joined insourcing business, Totally Healthcare, as Managing Director. Marie has a wealth of experience in the healthcare sector, insourcing services in multiple specialties throughout the UK and Ireland.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2004, Marie co-formed Medinet, provider of outsourced and insourced medical services, treating over 620,000 patients. Marie has worked with more than 100 Hospitals, helping to reduce patient waiting times, through cost effective solutions.
          </p>
          <p>
            She is supported by a team of experienced clinicians, including Dr Graham Turner, Medical Advisor for Totally Healthcare and Consultant Gastroenterologist at the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust.
          </p>
          <p>
            The NHS has experienced issues over the years in reaching their 18-week targets – the time in which a patient is expected to see a specialist following a GP referral. Insourcing is an innovative way to meet these targets by using the hospital’s spare capacity in the evening and weekends to provide these services.
          </p>
          <p>
            Marie says, “I am passionate about helping hospitals to reduce the pressures caused by long waiting lists, and importantly I am also dedicated to ensuring the highest quality care is given to patients.
          </p>
          <p>
            “We are all users of the NHS and I am proud to work in a business which works to support getting care to patients in a timely manner.”
